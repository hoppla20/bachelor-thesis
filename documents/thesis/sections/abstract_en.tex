\Abstract

Distributed systems, like grid and cloud computing, have become essential for
sharing of and accessing to remote resources. These systems are often used for
economic reasons or to simplify collaboration and exchange of information.
Because the maintenance and management of these distributed systems and the
hardware it is running on is very complex and expensive, these tasks are often
outsourced to service providers.

However, certain industries may have stricter security and trust requirements
and governments too are growing more concerned with the privacy and
confidentiality of user data\todo{DSGVO?}. Confidential computing is an upcoming
technology that seeks to address this trust issue by guaranteeing both privacy
and integrity of data and code while enabling remote attestation.

This paper will explore different platforms that facilitate sharing of resources
while make use of confidential computing in order to preserve the privacy of
client data. It will also investigate limitations imposed by the use of
confidential computing and finally showcase challenges of realizing a secure
joint distributed system.
