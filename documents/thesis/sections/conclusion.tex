The aim of this thesis was the introduction of a new trusted distributed
computing model that protects the confidentiality of tenants data. The resulting
model is based on the integration of confidential computing technologies and
remote attestation procedures into the traditional distributed computing model.
The defined threat model identified threats and issues that arise when service
providers of the traditional model become untrusted and the evaluation of the
trusted model upon this threat model has shown how trusted execution
environments mitigate these threats and solve issues in existing mitigations.

The split of trust however comes with trade-offs. The traditional model allowed
tenants to shift more and more responsibilities to the service provider,
reducing the complexity of applications. The trusted model reduces this benefit
by giving responsibilities that could lead to the compromise of the
confidentiality of data back to the application.

We have also seen limitations that are currently still present in confidential
computing technologies that are mainly concerned with performance limitations.
These performance limitations diminish the cost-efficiency of distributed
computing systems and in some use cases not acceptable.

Furthermore, confidential computing technologies are still a relatively new, and
their integrations into other software such as hypervisors, firmware, operating
systems, and into the remote attestation process are still in early stages,
requiring further research and testing.

While cloud providers are eager to adopt this new technology and are already
offering services based on confidential computing technologies, the two case
studies have shown that both the Infrastructure layer and the Platform layer are
currently still not fulfilling all requirements of the trusted distributed
computing model.

Nevertheless, confidential computing provides very promising hardware-based
primitives that could allow a new generation of trustworthy distributed
computing systems. Further research will tell whether current limitations and
implementation challenges can be solved while preserving the confidentiality
promises.
