\begin{itemize}
  \item Grid
  \item Cloud
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition}

\citetitle{mell2011} \cite{mell2011} defines cloud computing as a model in order
to enable ``ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources [...] that can be rapidly provisioned and
released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction''. It
extracts essential characteristics, service models, and deployment models:

\subsubsection{Characteristics}

\begin{itemize}
  \item On-demand self-service
  \item Broad network access
  \item Resource pooling
  \item Rapid elasticity
  \item Measured service
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Service Models}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Software as a Service (SaaS)
  \item Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  \item Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Deployment Models}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Private cloud
  \item Community cloud
  \item Public cloud
  \item Hybrid
\end{itemize}
