\section{Remote Attestation}
\label{sec:remote-attestation}

Remote attestation is the process that allows a remote party to verify the
trustworthiness of a device or platform. \citetitle{rfc9334} \cite{rfc9334}
provides a standardized framework for remote attestation, which defines various
roles, protocols, and data structures involved in this process. This section
will give an overview of the remote attestation process.

\end{figure}

Remote attestation begins with the relying party requesting a verification of
the attester. Subsequently, the attester generates evidence about its
trustworthiness, which the verifier uses in combination with endorsements from
endorsers and reference values from reference value providers by applying an
appraisal policy to assess the trustworthiness of the attester. After receiving
the attestation results from the verifier, the relying party applies its own
appraisal policy to make an application-specific decision, such as performing a
privileged action or releasing confidential data to the attester. This process
is illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:rats-data-flow}.

We will assume that the verifier has already established trust and a secure
communication channel with the relying party. \citetitle{rfc9334} outlines how
the trust between those two roles can be established \cite[Section~7.1]{rfc9334}

\subsection{Chain of Trust}
\label{sec:ra-chain-of-trust}

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Remote attestation chain of trust.}
  \label{fig:ra-chain-of-trust}
\end{figure}

Typically, a verifier comes to trust an attester indirectly by having an
endorser, creating a chain of trust. The root of the chain of trust is the
endorser root key. The endorser provisions each attester with an attestation
key, which is used to sign evidence. At the very least, the private part of the
attestation key must be stored in tamper-proof hardware to prevent unauthorized
access to the key. The endorser then issues an endorsement certificate which
includes the public attestation key, and signs the certificate using its own
private endorsement root key.

The endorsement certificate represents the endorsement from the endorser that
the attester can be trusted. Both the endorsement certificate and the public
part of the endorser root key have to be provided to the verifier. Before
starting the first verification, the verifier has to authenticate the
endorsement certificate by validating its signature using the public endorser
root key.

Evidence produced by the attester is signed by the attester using the
attestation key. After receiving evidence from the attester, the verifier first
verifies that the attester produced the evidence by validating its signature
using the public attestation key, which is included in the endorsement
certificate. Subsequently, the verifier confirms the integrity of the evidence
using the signature.

Finally, after validating the authenticity and integrity of the evidence, the
verifier appraises the evidence and conveys the attestation results to the
relying party.

\subsection{Secure Communication Channel between Attester and Relying Party}
\label{sec:ra-secure-communication-channel}

\begin{figure}[H]

  \label{fig:ra-key-exchange}
\end{figure}

The remote attestation process can also be used to establish a secure
communication channel between the attester and the relying party. This can be
achieved by integrating a key agreement protocol into the remote attestation
process. This section will outline how a secure channel can be established
between the attester and the relying party using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
as an example (see Section \ref{sec:key-agreement}). To simplify the
illustration, we will assume that the prime number $p$ and generator $g$ are
already specified by the protocol or have already been agreed upon.

The relying party starts the attestation process by requesting a verification of
the attester. In the request, the relying party includes the first key exchange
message $pub_A$. The attester then includes the second key exchange message
$pub_B$ in the produced evidence. Because the evidence is signed using the
attestation key, the key exchange message is part of the chain of trust,
allowing the verifier to validate the authenticity and integrity of the key
exchange message. After successful verification, the verifier includes the key
exchange message in the attestation result. Now $pub_A$ and $pub_B$ have been
exchanged between the attester and the relying party, allowing the derivation of
the shared secret $K$ that can be used to establish a secure communication
channel between both parties.

A man-in-the-middle attack between the attester and the verifier can easily be
detected because modification of the key exchange message would result in the
verification of the integrity of the evidence failing.

While this illustration is about the establishment of a secure communication
channel in the remote attestation process, current ongoing work by
\citeauthor{fossati-tls-attestation-02} \cite{fossati-tls-attestation-02}
proposes the reverse, integration of the remote attestation process into the
already well-established TLS protocol.
