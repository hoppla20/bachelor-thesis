\chapter{Confidential Computing}
\label{ch:confidential-computing}

\section{Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)}
\label{sec:TEE}

Defined by Confidential Computing Consortium.

\subsection{Properties}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Data confidentiality
  \item Data integrity
  \item Code integrity
\end{itemize}

Depending on the specific TEE, it may also provide:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Code confidentiality
  \item Authenticated Launch
  \item Programmability
  \item Attestation
  \item Recoverability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Confidential Computing Environments (CCEs)}

Defined by Edgeless Systems. \hyperref[sec:TEE]{Trusted Execution Environment}
with specific capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Runtime encryption (Data confidentiality/integrity)
  \item Isolation
  \item Remote attestation
\end{itemize}

\section{TEE Flavors}

\subsection{Virtual-Machine-based TEE}

AMD SEV, Intel TDX, IBM Secure Execution and PEF, ...

\subsection{Process-based TEE}

Intel SGX, ...

Application Splitting:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Enclave
  \item Host
\end{itemize}
