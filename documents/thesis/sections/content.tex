\chapter{Confidential Computing}
\label{ch:confidential-computing}

\section{Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)}
\label{sec:TEE}

Defined by Confidential Computing Consortium.

\subsection{Properties}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Data confidentiality
  \item Data integrity
  \item Code integrity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trusted Computing Base (TCB)}

Depending on the specific TEE, it may also provide:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Code confidentiality
  \item Authenticated Launch
  \item Programmability
  \item Attestation
  \item Recoverability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Models}

\subsubsection{Virtual-Machine-based TEE}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Memory encrypted VM running on top of a VMM \todo{Explain VMM}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Process-based TEE}

Application Splitting:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Enclave:} Contains trusted component, resides in encrypted
        memory.
  \item \textbf{Host:} Interfaces with the OS and propagates I/O from encrypted
        memory to the rest of the system.
\end{itemize}
