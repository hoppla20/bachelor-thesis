In use cases that require the use of remote attestation, such as confidential computing or device onboarding, an attester has to convey evidence or attestation results to a relying party. This information exchange may happen at different layers in the protocol stack. This specification provides a generic way of passing evidence and attestation results in the TLS handshake. Functionality-wise this is accomplished with the help of key attestation.}

  abstract  = {Library OSes are a promising approach for applications to efficiently obtain the benefits of virtual machines, including security isolation, host platform compatibility, and migration. Library OSes refactor a traditional OS kernel into an application library, avoiding overheads incurred by duplicate functionality. When compared to running a single application on an OS kernel in a VM, recent library OSes reduce the memory footprint by an order-of-magnitude.Previous library OS (libOS) research has focused on single-process applications, yet many Unix applications, such as network servers and shell scripts, span multiple processes. Key design challenges for a multi-process libOS include management of shared state and minimal expansion of the security isolation boundary.This paper presents Graphene, a library OS that seamlessly and efficiently executes both single and multi-process applications, generally with low memory and performance overheads. Graphene broadens the libOS paradigm to support secure, multi-process APIs, such as copy-on-write fork, signals, and System V IPC. Multiple libOS instances coordinate over pipe-like byte streams to implement a consistent, distributed POSIX abstraction. These coordination streams provide a simple vantage point to enforce security isolation.},

  abstract   = {Machine-Learning tasks are becoming pervasive in a broad range of domains, and in a broad range of systems (from embedded systems to data centers). At the same time, a small set of machine-learning algorithms (especially Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks, i.e., CNNs and DNNs) are proving to be state-of-the-art across many applications. As architectures evolve towards heterogeneous multi-cores composed of a mix of cores and accelerators, a machine-learning accelerator can achieve the rare combination of efficiency (due to the small number of target algorithms) and broad application scope.Until now, most machine-learning accelerator designs have focused on efficiently implementing the computational part of the algorithms. However, recent state-of-the-art CNNs and DNNs are characterized by their large size. In this study, we design an accelerator for large-scale CNNs and DNNs, with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance and energy.We show that it is possible to design an accelerator with a high throughput, capable of performing 452 GOP/s (key NN operations such as synaptic weight multiplications and neurons outputs additions) in a small footprint of 3.02 mm2 and 485 mW; compared to a 128-bit 2GHz SIMD processor, the accelerator is 117.87x faster, and it can reduce the total energy by 21.08x. The accelerator characteristics are obtained after layout at 65 nm. Such a high throughput in a small footprint can open up the usage of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in a broad set of systems and for a broad set of applications.},

The theory shows how to reason about a principal's authority by deducing the other principals that it can speak for; authenticating a channel is one important application. We use the theory to explain many existing and proposed security mechanisms. In particular, we describe the system we have built. It passes principals efficiently as arguments or results of remote procedure calls, and it handles public and shared key encryption, name lookup in a large name space, groups of principals, program loading, delegation, access control, and revocation.},

A multitenant platform hosts and executes software from several users (tenants). The platform must ensure that no malicious or faulty code from any tenant can interfere with the normal execution of other users’ code or with the platform itself. This security requirement is specially relevant in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds. PaaS clouds offer an execution environment based on some software platform. Unless PaaS systems are deemed as safe environments users will be reluctant to trust them to run any relevant application. This requires to take into account how multitenancy is handled by the software platform used as the basis of the PaaS offer. This survey focuses on two technologies that are or will be the platform-of-choice in many PaaS clouds: Java and .NET. We describe the security mechanisms they provide, study their limitations as multitenant platforms and analyze the research works that try to solve those limitations. We include in this analysis some standard container technologies (such as Enterprise Java Beans) that can be used to standardize the hosting environment of PaaS clouds. Also we include a brief discussion of Operating Systems (OSs) traditional security capacities and why OSs are unlikely to be chosen as the basis of PaaS offers. Finally, we describe some research initiatives that reinforce security by monitoring the execution of untrusted code, whose results can be of interest in multitenant systems.}

By outsourcing computation and storage requirements to public providers and paying for the services used, customers can relish upon the advantages of this new paradigm. Cloud computing provides with a comparably lower-cost, scalable, a location-independent platform for managing clients' data. Compared to a traditional model of computing, which uses dedicated in-house infrastructure, cloud computing provides unprecedented benefits regarding cost and reliability. Cloud storage is a new cost-effective paradigm that aims at providing high availability, reliability, massive scalability and data sharing. However, outsourcing data to a cloud service provider introduces new challenges from the perspectives of data correctness and security. Over the years, many data integrity schemes have been proposed for protecting outsourced data. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of security issues associated with cloud storage and highlights the importance of data integrity schemes for outsourced data. In this paper, we have presented a taxonomy of existing data integrity schemes use for cloud storage. A comparative analysis of existing schemes is also provided along with a detailed discussion on possible security attacks and their mitigations. Additionally, we have discussed design challenges such as computational efficiency, storage efficiency, communication efficiency, and reduced I/O in these schemes. Furthermore, we have highlighted future trends and open issues, for future research in cloud storage security.}

The reviewed schemas are provable data possession (PDP) and proofs of retrievability (POR). Both are cryptographic protocols designed to provide clients the assurance that their data are secure on the untrusted data storages.

In order to better define the threats to which a cloud server's Hypervisor is exposed, we conducted a thorough analysis of the codebase of two popular open-source Hypervisors, Xen and KVM, followed by an extensive study of the vulnerability reports associated with them. Based on our findings, we propose a characterization of Hypervisor Vulnerabilities comprised of three dimensions: the trigger source (i.e. where the attacker is located), the attack vector (i.e. the Hypervisor functionality that enables the security breach), and the attack target (i.e. the runtime domain that is compromised). This can be used to understand potential paths different attacks can take, and which vulnerabilities enable them. Moreover, most common paths can be discovered to learn where the defenses should be focused, or conversely, least common paths can be used to find yet-unexplored ways attackers may use to get into the system.},

However, the hypervisor, with a full control over hardware resources, can access the memory pages of guest VMs without any restriction. By compromising the hypervisor, a malicious user can access the memory contents of the VMs used by other users.In this paper, we propose a hardware-based mechanism to protect the memory of guest VMs from unauthorized accesses, even with an untrusted hypervisor. With this mechanism, memory isolation is provided by the secure hardware, which is much less vulnerable than the software hypervisor. The proposed mechanism extends the current hardware support for memory virtualization with a small extra hardware cost. The hypervisor can still flexibly allocate physical memory pages to virtual machines for efficient resource management. However, the hypervisor can update nested page tables only through the secure hardware mechanism, which verifies each mapping change. Using the hardware-oriented mechanism in each system securing guest VMs under a vulnerable hypervisor, this paper also proposes a cloud system architecture, which supports the authenticated launch and migration of guest VMs.},

  abstract  = {Virtualization has become a standard part of many computer systems. A key part of virtualization is the all-powerful hypervisor which manages the physical platform and can access all of its resources, including memory assigned to the guest virtual machines (VMs). Continuing releases of bug reports and exploits in the virtualization software show that defending the hypervisor against attacks is very difficult. In this work, we present hypervisor-secure virtualization - a new research direction with the goal of protecting the guest VMs from an untrusted hypervisor. We also present the HyperWall architecture which achieves hypervisor-secure virtualization, using hardware to provide the protections. HyperWall allows a hypervisor to freely manage the memory, processor cores and other resources of a platform. Yet once VMs are created, our new Confidentiality and Integrity Protection (CIP) tables protect the memory of the guest VMs from accesses by the hypervisor or by DMA, depending on the customer's specification. If a hypervisor does become compromised, e.g. by an attack from a malicious VM, it cannot be used in turn to attack other VMs. The protections are enabled through minimal modifications to the microprocessor and memory management units. Whereas much of the previous work concentrates on protecting the hypervisor from attacks by guest VMs, we tackle the problem of protecting the guest VMs from the hypervisor.},

  abstract  = {Third-party cloud computing represents the promise of outsourcing as applied to computation. Services, such as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's EC2, allow users to instantiate virtual machines (VMs) on demand and thus purchase precisely the capacity they require when they require it. In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information from a target VM on the same machine.},

Homomorphic encryption provides a means for securely transmitting and storing confidential information across and in a computer system. The aim of this paper is to discuss the concepts and significance of homomorphic encryption along with the subdivisions and limitations associated with this type of encryption scheme. Recent studies conducted on the topic of homomorphic encryption are highlighted and some customary models of homomorphism are demonstrated. We also developed a proof of concept algorithm that demonstrates a practical use for a homomorphic encryption technique, the results of our algorithm are provided. The applications of homomorphic encryption methods are vast outside of the computational realm, and its purpose in other fields will be explored.}

  abstract   = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have been widely used in many security-critical applications. The popularity of TEEs derives from its high security and trustworthiness supported by secure hardware. Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is one of the most representative TEEs that creates an isolated environment on an untrusted operating system, thus providing run-time protection for the execution of security-critical code and data. However, Intel SGX is far from the acme of perfection. It has become a target of various attacks due to its security vulnerabilities. Researchers and practitioners have paid attention to the security vulnerabilities of SGX and investigated optimization solutions in real applications. Unfortunately, existing literature lacks a thorough review of security vulnerabilities of SGX and their countermeasures. In this article, we fill this gap. Specifically, we propose two sets of criteria for estimating security risks of existing attacks and evaluating defense effects brought by attack countermeasures. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy of SGX security vulnerabilities and shed light on corresponding attack vectors. After that, we review published attacks and existing countermeasures, as well as evaluate them by employing our proposed criteria. At last, on the strength of our survey, we propose some open challenges and future directions in the research of SGX security.},
